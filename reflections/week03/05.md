# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    - As the week progressed, I started to grasp the flow of mvc and why it is beneficial. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
    - I would say I am still struggling with being able to "code small, test small", and how to properly know what exactly I'm needing to test before continuing a portion of code. 
- What would you count as a victory?
    -By the end of the week, whenever I needed help, I was able to understand where a problem was occurring and be able to describe how it was occurring, as well as comprehend how/why the solution worked.
