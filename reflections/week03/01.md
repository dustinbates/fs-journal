## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
    - Exports solve many problems such as performance issues of having multiple scripts linked to an html, eradicating naming conflicts, easier debugging, and unorganized code. 

2. How does export differ from export default?
    - I'm not entirely sure. Export seems to export the entirety of a module, while export default seems to only export the function of it?

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
    - Using the module system helps to organize your code. With modules, if a file is changed or moved the problem becomes obvious and therefore much easier to resolve.
