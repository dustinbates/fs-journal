> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
    -The observer pattern seeks to solve updating a page in one or many places with provided data, in response to certain events. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
    -Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast. Subscribe adds a list of callback functions into an array. Unsubscribe filters the list and reassigns the list of observers. Broadcast iterates through the list of observed events and executes all callbacks.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
    - To my understanding, the template utilizes the observer pattern to observe when and where to draw a new box to the screen with data generated from a function?
