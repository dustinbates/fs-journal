## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
    -Encapsulation was made as a way to prevent all data from having to be accessible everywhere. This allows certain data to be "locked-away" so only the code it's required for can interact with it, rather than any user being able to alter it. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    - Some people were ignoring the purpose of underscores and using code that was supposed to be "private" improperly. Also, hackers man.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    -We create private variables by writing them outside of the class's {}. We would do this to keep certain functions from being accessible to users who manipulate the dom with the command prompt.
