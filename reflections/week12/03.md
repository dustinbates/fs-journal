# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
  - Getting my first grade was a good choice. I still have a lot of little things to work out, but I'll be done by tomorrow I'm sure. 
- Are you managing your stress?
  - Asking for help when I get overwhelmed
- What has you most worried?
  - I'm worried that I won't be as confident after graduation when I don't have a TA to give their insight...
