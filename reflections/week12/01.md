# Daily Reflection

## Prompts

  - Today is going great! I've finished my back end and have a good layout of my home page. 
- Are you managing your stress?
  - I haven't stressed much yet. Taking regular breaks and timeboxing the important things first. 
- What has you most worried? 
  - I'm only worried that I won't be satisfied with the end result, even when it's passing.
