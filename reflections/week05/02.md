## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
    -One to one, one to many, and many to many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
    -Linking will not grow the size of the original document, can allow for easier pagination, decrease IO load, and increase write performance. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
    -Some challenges faced would be the size of one relationship to the other. In their example, the number of books outweighs the number of categories; so using one-way embedding to embed the category in the book makes sense. The size is an issue as well with their example of favorites. Since a user can have many favorites, it makes more sense to have a third collection to use as a relationship.
