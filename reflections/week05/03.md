## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
    -Timeboxing is setting aside chunks of time to dedicate toward working on a task. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
    -I will try to implement prioritizing, "strategic quitting", and flexibility. I will find the tasks that are highest priority, work through them until they are no longer the highest, and be flexible with the time that needs to be dedicated toward them. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
    -During the Inspire checkpoint, I could have timeboxed the todos list better. It would have allowed me to get the functionality done, then complete the other tasks before spending a lot of time messing with the visuals.
