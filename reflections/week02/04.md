## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
    - Planning before starting to write code is important, as it will help you get a basic plan for what the project needs. Coming up with a basic layout will help determine where your functions will show up on the screen. This in turn will help in determining the initial functions that will need to be made. All of these will likely change as the project proceeds, but it gives you somewhere to start. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    - When I get stuck the first thing I do is try to Google the problem. If that doesn't help, I go back and try to re-evaluate what I wrote to ensure it makes sense. If I'm still stuck after that, I reach out to someone who might know more. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
    - My biggest take-away is to avoid writing notes that just say what the code does, and focus on WHY it should do what it does. Also, to take breaks when coding is getting too confusing.
