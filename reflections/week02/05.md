# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

    - I was able to get most lab work finished without having to work on them at home
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    - Using the right quotes in your code is pretty important
- What are you struggling with?
    - I am still having a bit of trouble with using arguments and parameters properly
- What would you count as a victory?
    - I was able to get all of the checkpoint requirements met before end of day on Friday!
