## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    - You can print to the console directly from your code, such as console.log, or you can write directly to the console in the console tab. Printing from your code can help to ensure things are working, like printing something when a button is clicked. Printing directly from the console can help when debugging. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    - The elements tab allows you to see the HTML/CSS of your code. This can be useful when debugging, as it allows you to highlight which sections are where, and make changes directly from that tab to see how they will affect your site before updating your code in VSCode.  

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    - Using the Source tab is a better way to debug. From there you can use breakpoints to see line by line the communication of your code, and help narrow down bugs faster than trial and error.
