## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
    - Scope is where a variable is available for use. Variables can be globally scoped, function scoped, block scoped. 

2. What is Hoisting ?
    - Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    - Most cases will use let, as it will be able to be updated but not re-declared within it's scope. A const would be used if something needs to be permanently set. A var would be used for a variable that can be changed any time you want.
