## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
  -Communication is important because it ensures all members of the team are on the same page. When the team keeps the other members up to speed with what is being done, what hold-ups are occurring, and what needs to be done next, the work progress will flow smoothly. 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
  -Streamlined communication is a main adjustment for smaller teams. Adapting the workflow to meet the needs of the project, such as running parallel sprints, is another. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
  -The unattainable triangle is the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered. Good service cheap won't be fast. Good service fast won't be cheap. Fast service cheap won't be good.
