## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
  -Unit testing, tests individual units of code to ensure operation and provide confidence that the code works as intended. 
  -Component testing, tests the components of Vue that are being mounted to the DOM, and provides error reports for what tests are failing and WHY the test are failing. 
  -End to end testing, tests the front and back end of the application, what actually happens when users use the app. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
  -I think unit testing is most important, because if you are constantly ensuring that all the units that are making up the whole of your app are working, it will likely mean the whole app will work pretty well. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
  -I'm not sure that any of these testing methods would be least useful. However, I guess component testing might be the least because as long as the units of that component are working, the component shouldn't be as likely to have failures.
