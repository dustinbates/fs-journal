## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
  -Inheritance allows us to have reusable code, by enabling us to define a new class based on an existing class. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
  -Member inheritance allows a derived class to inherit all but the constructors, finalizers, and private members of it's parent class. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
  -Accessibility determines whether the derived class can access and use members of the parent class. Public members are accessible, protected members are only visible in the derived class, and internal are visible in derived classes located in the same assembly as the parent class.
