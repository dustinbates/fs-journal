## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

  - Overall, I have enjoyed my experiences throughout this course immensely. I came in to this class with very little knowledge of code, and have reached a point where I now think about code constantly. Every website or app I use makes me think "I know how they made this look like that!". The lessons have been in-depth enough to understand, while leaving enough "I wonder how this would work" to keep me wanting to learn more. I greatly appreciate all the staff, everyone is so nice, helpful, funny, and genuine. With their support and helpful insight, I feel confident that I can continue to develop my skills and earn a role in the professional world. 
  I have a slight concern about finding a job after graduation, but that has nothing to do with the course and more to do with the economy at the moment. I plan to manage my time after graduation with re-coding the projects we made in class with the improved knowledge I have now, as well as setting aside time to network and apply for ideal jobs. 
  The thing I've enjoyed most about the course is definitely the people I've met. All my classmates and all the staff are people I won't forget and hope to keep up with in the future. I'll admit, I also enjoyed the laid-back nature of everything. Being able to play the arcade machine, have a round of ping pong, and go outside whenever I want was a significant factor in making me want to go to class each day. 
  I want to thank everyone at CodeWorks for this experience. I hope they've enjoyed having me as much as I've enjoyed being a part of their course!
