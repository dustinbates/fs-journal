## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
  - A primary key is a unique identifier, not repeated, and all values must be different from each other. Example used is a license plate number to identify a specific car. A foreign key is used to reference data on another table. It is similar to a primary key, but you would tell the foreign key which table it is coming from. Example used is a customer table that has a rented car found by it's license plate number. 

2. What is an `Alias`?
  - An alias is a shortened version of an instance of a table name that can be used in place of writing out the full table name. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT 
p.*
FROM patients p
INNER JOIN doctorPatients dp ON dp.patientId = p.id
INNER JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
WHERE d.id = {doctorId};
```
