## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
  -User experience is just that; the experience a user has on your site or app. You should consider what the user will want to do on your site, whether they feel comfortable rather than confused, etc. 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
  -Some benefits would be that your site will turn out nice. If the site has good user experience, it will most likely be a good-looking, smooth operating, pleasant experience to use. 

3. Why is the User Experience important?
  -If you expect anyone to actually use your site, enjoy using it, and potentially get others to use it, it will need to provide a good experience. If the site is ugly, clunky, confusing, and hard to use, it will not do well in the professional world.
