## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
  -In some ways, I utilized "paired programming" when getting assistance from TAs for this week's checkpoint. I also considered ways to provide a good user experience when finalizing my Tower assignment. 

2. What went well this week?
  -I got a duck on both The Network and Tower! 

3. What would you do differently?
  -I would try to make a list of all the important things I was struggling with in order to get assistance on them first, which would give me a little more time to do finishing touches in the end.
