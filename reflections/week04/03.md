## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
    -To utilize the abilities of promises, while making code look like it's synchronous while being async and non-blocking. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
    -The function must first be async. Await will return a promise, but async will make the calling code stop until the promise is resolved or rejected. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
    -They make code easier to read, they can be used multiple times in series with each other, and they make debugging easier.
