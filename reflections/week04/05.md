# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    -I didn't feel /extremely/ lost at the start of this week
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    -APIs are SO COOL
- What are you struggling with?
    -I feel like I could stand to learn more about the CRUD method
- What would you count as a victory?
    -I met all requirements of the checkpoint on my own, only asking help for some style options
