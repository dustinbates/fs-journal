> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
    -Some signs could include large, multi-line chunks within code, followed by several "pyramid shaped" end brackets. Causes include function processes being put directly below their first call in an attempt to read from top down. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
    -Async in terms of Javascript means "takes some time" or "happens in the future". Callbacks are involved by returning the request at a later time, such as after a download finishes, rather than immediately upon firing. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
    -Keep code shallow: give functions names to make it easier to read, and be able to move and reference functions by their names.
    -Modularize: separate the things that can work together to become something that can be referenced in one line elsewhere. 
    -Handle every error: expect errors to happen, write them into your code, prioritizing them first, and ensure they get resolved when they happen.
