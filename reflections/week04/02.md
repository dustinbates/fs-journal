## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
    - Pending, resolved, and rejected. Pending is the waiting period from the request. Resolved is if the request successfully competed. Rejected is if it failed. 

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
    - Promises can resolve callback hell by ensuring that a function completes before moving on to the next one, either successfully, or by stopping when an error is hit. Chaining promises can also make code easier to read. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
    -Then (same thing as Try I think?) is what will attempt to perform the task and return the resolved promise. Catch will return the rejected promise.
