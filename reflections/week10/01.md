## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
  -Value type, reference type, and pointer type. Value type holds a data value within its own memory space. Reference type stores the address where the value is being stored. Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
  -Bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. C# variables must be declared at creation, while JavaScript can change at runtime. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
  -When an object is created, a block of memory is created to hold the object's data, and a reference to that is returned. Then the reference is stored in a variable or passed as a parameter to a method. Value types store their data directly to memory.
