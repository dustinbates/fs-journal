## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
  -My group has used the SCRUM principles throughout each day. We start our days with a quick meeting to see where we are and what still needs to be done, then a short follow-up meeting after lunch to lock down our daily sprints. We are also using two APIs from Google and New York Times to get data for our books. 

2. What went well so far?
  -Overall I think our communication and planning has gone very well. We always had a task to complete, and did not get in each other's way while working simultaneously in our project. Our end result is pretty nice too!

3. What would you do differently? Why?
  -If I had to do anything differently I would maybe try to look deeper into using APIs. The ones we used work well for our mobile app, but since we only use the free Google API, we only get thumbnail sized images. It would be nice to have an API that gives better images so our desktop search results would look a bit nicer.
