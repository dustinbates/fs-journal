## Questions

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
  -We have used onMounted to call functions on page load. I have also used onUpdated to implement timeago.js in my checkpoint. 

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
  -Mounting hooks access a component immediately before and after the first render. We use them when calling functions like "getPosts" on page load.
