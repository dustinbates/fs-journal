## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
    - Wire-frames keep the content user focused, clarify and define website features, and are cheap and quick to create. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
    - Low, mid, and high-fidelity. Low is useful for creating the basic idea of a website. Mid is useful for adding more detailed info to the initial concept. High is useful for creating all the specifics of how the whole site needs to look prior to coding it.  

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    - Yes, I think wire-frames are worth it because they allow a high level of detail and specificity to be made before any code hits the screen. This allows quick and easy edits to be made to ensure the layout will look exactly how the code needs to replicate.
