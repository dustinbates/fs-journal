# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    - Each topic covered this week made sense to me. I didn't feel lost on any particular thing during lecture. Implementing the lessons into the labs was not an extreme challenge, just the initial getting the hang of things. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    - It's hard to say anything this week was shocking or surprising, considering this week was mostly a re-cap of the pre-course work I had gone through before class began. If I hadn't taken the pre-course work, I would say Bootstrap! 
- What are you struggling with?
    - The main things I've run into trouble with is getting d-flex, justify-content, and align-items to work the way I want. After asking a TA on Friday, though, I feel more confident in their usage. 
- What would you count as a victory?
    - Being able to successfully recreate (mostly) the clone sites on my own with minimal help!
