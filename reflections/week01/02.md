## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
    - A word added to a selector that determines a specific state of the selected element. :hover seems to be used frequently.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
    - Specificity determines the style that is most relevant to an element. It could be used to allow an element with multiple similar styles to appear in a specific way? (I don't fully grasp the importance of specificity at the moment.)

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
    - Over-utilizing could cause certain elements to be overwritten by their "!importance" and cause them to appear completely wrong on your site.
